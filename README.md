# Recursion
This set of programs includes my solutions to The Odin Project's recursion project in Ruby.

## Fibonacci
#fibs is a method that takes a number and returns that many members of the fibonacci sequence. It is implemented using iteration.

#fibs_rec solves the problem recursively.

## Merge Sort
#merge_sort is a method that takes in an array and returns a sorted array, using a recursive merge sort methodology.
